I decided to bootstrap this task with create-react-app for speed and ease of development.

You can clone this repo, and after running:

#### `npm install`

you can run the app on localhost:3000 by running:

#### `npm start`

I hope this is close to what you were looking for. I look forward to discussing some of
the decisions I made and how I would improve the app given more time.
